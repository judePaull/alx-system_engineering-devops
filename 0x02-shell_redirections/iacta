Beneath the silver moon's soft, gentle grace,
A world awakens in a tranquil embrace,
The stars above in their celestial dance,
Twinkle and shimmer in a cosmic trance.
In fields of green, the flowers sway and sing,
Their fragrant melodies of joy they bring,
A river whispers secrets to the trees,
As nature's lullaby floats on the breeze.
In this serene and peaceful midnight hour,
We find in nature's beauty, inner power,
A reminder of the wonders that abound,
In the quietude of night, we are profound.
